In this project, you’re going to make your own table with some small set of “famous people”, then make more tables about things they do and join those to create nice human readable lists.
For example, here are types of famous people and the questions your data could answer:

Movie stars: What movies are they in? Are they married to each other?

/* What are the Stars name and age? */
SELECT name, age FROM Star;

/* What are the Movie titles? */
SELECT Title FROM movies;

/* What movies are the Stars in? */
SELECT a.name, b.title 
FROM star a
JOIN movies b
ON a.id = b.star;

/* Who are the Stars spouses? */
SELECT name,  spouse
FROM star;
