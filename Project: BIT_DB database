In SQLlite I downloaded and connected to the database BIT_DB for this project. This database holds customer purchase orders and the months for those orders. 

To find out the data we are working with.
SELECT * 
FROM customers c
JOIN Jansales j
ON c.order_ID=j.orderID
LIMIT 20;

#1. How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM JanSales
WHERE Product='iPhone'
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT DISTINCT acctnum
FROM customers C
INNER JOIN FebSales F
ON C.order_id=F.orderid
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT DISTINCT Product, price
FROM JanSales
WHERE  price IN (SELECT MIN(price) FROM JanSales);


#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT SUM(quantity)*price AS revenue
,product
FROM JanSales
GROUP BY product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT 
SUM(Quantity), 
product, 
SUM(quantity)*price AS revenue
FROM FebSales 
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT 
COUNT(DISTINCT C.acctnum), 
AVG(quantity*price)
FROM FebSales F
LEFT OUTER JOIN customers c
ON F.orderid=c.order_id
WHERE F.Quantity>2
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

8. List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.

SELECT Product, SUM(quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE location LIKE '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY Product;
